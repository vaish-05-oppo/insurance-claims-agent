# 🛡 Autonomous Insurance Claims Processing Agent

A lightweight AI-inspired web application built with **React.js** that automates the initial processing of **First Notice of Loss (FNOL)** insurance claims.

The application extracts important claim information from uploaded **TXT** and **PDF** documents, validates mandatory fields, classifies the claim, recommends the correct processing workflow, and generates the required JSON output.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

This application automates the initial processing by:

- Extracting important claim information
- Identifying missing mandatory fields
- Detecting suspicious claim descriptions
- Routing claims to the appropriate workflow
- Generating structured JSON output
